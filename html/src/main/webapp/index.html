				This game was designed to be usable as a math learning assessment
				instrument as part of the <a href="http://etsgameschallenge.com/">ETS
					Assessment Games Challenge</a>. It is structured around the <a
					href="http://etsgameschallenge.com/details/learningprogression">Equality
					and Variable: Equations and Expressions Model</a> learning progression.
				There are two ways to use game results as part of a learning
				assessment: through <em>game summary</em> and through the <em>score</em>.
			</p>

			<h3>Assessment by Game Summary</h3>
			<p>Many of the badges and demerits earned during the game are
				designed to correspond to the levels of the Equations and Expression
				learning progression. The game summary screen indicates how many
				times each badge and demerit was earned, and this should be taken
				into account when using the game to assess a player's place in the
				learning progression.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>
					Demerit: <span class="demerit">Not an Equation</span>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This demerit is earned when a player commits a sequence that does
						not form an equation at all. The sequence would otherwise be a
						legal move, so this demerit does not represent a misunderstanding
						of the rules of the game, but rather the rules of mathematics. As
						such, it corresponds to <span class="level">Level 1</span> in the
						learning progression.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>
					Demerit: <span class="demerit">Unbalanced Equation</span> and <span
						class="demerit">Unbalanced Variable Equation</span>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						These demerits are earned by playing well-formed equations that
						are false, such as <span class="math">5=1+1</span> or <span
							class="math">A=10</span> with <span class="math">A</span> bound
						to anything besides <span class="math">10</span>. The difference
						between the two demerits is simply whether the unbalanced equation
						used variables or not. A player who earns this demerit a few times
						may simply be making computational errors, but a player who earns
						it consistently demonstrates <span class="level">Level 1</span> of
						the learning progression: a fundamental misunderstanding of the
						relationship between expressions represented by equality and, for
						the latter demerit, variables.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>
					Badge: <span class="badge">Variable Reuse</span>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This badge is earned by creating an equation that uses a variable
						that the player had previously bound to a value. Earning this
						badge reflects a minimum of <span class="level">Level 2</span> of
						the learning progression; the player understands that the variable
						can have a specific value, and that value "sticks."
					</p>
				<dt>
					Badge: <span class="badge">Operators on Either Side</span>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This badge is earned by playing at least two non-trivial equations
						in which a single integer value is on the left and the right. For
						example, a student could earn this by playing <span class="math">1+1=2</span>
						and <span class="math">4=2+2</span>. Earning this badge
						corresponds to <span class="level">Level 3</span> of the learning
						progression: it demonstrates an understanding that the two sides
						of an equal sign can be exchanged&mdash; that there is not a
						dependency on having operations on one side or the other.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>
					Badge: <span class="badge">Operators on Both Sides</span>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This badge is earned by playing an equation in which operators are
						used on both sides of an equal sign, such as <span class="math">1+1=2-0</span>.
						It corresponds to <span class="level">Level 4</span> of the
						learning progression, a richer understanding of equality and the
						equivalence of the two sides of an equation, regardless of their
						structure.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>
					Badge: <span class="badge">Many Equals</span>
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This badge is earned by playing an equation with more than one
						equal sign, such as <span class="math">5=3+2=1+4</span>. It also
						corresponds to <span class="level">Level 4</span> of the learning
						progression, where a player is using a rich understanding of
						equality as a relationship among expressions.
					</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>

			<p>
				Other demerits included in the game may provide an educator with
				insight into a player's weak points. For example, a player who earns
				<span class="demerit">Divide by Zero</span> more than once likely
				does not have a good understanding of <em>why</em> this cannot be
				done,
			</p>

			<h3>Assessment by Score</h3>
			<p>
				Players' scores also provide a rough approximation of their
				understanding of equations and expressions. Simple identity
				equations such as <span class="math">5=5</span> are worth zero
				points, and while punting does not incur a penalty, it does have an
				opportunity cost. Hence, a low score probably indicates that the
				player is not savvy with manipulating mathematical symbols into
				valid equations. Similarly, players with high scores are likely to
				have demonstrated significant ability with mathematical
				manipulations. More detailed assessment requires looking at the game
				summaries, as described above.
			</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Why isn't the board showing up?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						The game is written to a draft specification of HTML5, and since
						there is no definitive standard, different browsers may behave
						differently. We've tested the game primarily using the <a
							href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google
							Chrome</a> browser, which is free and recommended for playing the
						game. The game should be playable on <a
							href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a>,
						but may not run properly on <a
							href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/products/ie/home/">Microsoft
							Internet Explorer</a>
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Is the set of symbols used the same each game?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Each game, you have the same number of digits and variables.
						However, the set of operators is different each time. The most
						common operation is addition, with decreasing probabilities of
						drawing subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Why are division equations such as <span class="math">3&divide;2=1</span>
					accepted?
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						We are doing <i>integer arithmetic</i>, so division gives you the
						answer in whole numbers, not fractions or decimals. How many <span
							class="math">2</span>s go in <span class="math">3</span>? Only
						one. There is a remainder of one, but that's the result of a
						different operation&mdash;<i>modulo</i>&mdash;which is not
						included in the game.
					</p>
				</dd>

		<div id='about'>
			<p>
				This game was designed and developed in Summer&nbsp;2012
				by  <a
					href="https://plus.google.com/103828843747057637757/about">Paul
					Gestwicki</a>
				as an entry into the
				<a href="http://etsgameschallenge.com/">ETS Math Assessment Game Challenge</a>,
				specifically to align with the
				<a href="http://etsgameschallenge.com/details/learningprogression"><em>Equality
				and Variable: Equations and Expressions</em> Learning Progression</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Testers and friends have recommended a host of features, including a persistent high score table,
			  additional mathematical operations, and multiplayer and campaign modes. These are great ideas,
			  especially those that would increase both the fun and utility of the game with respect
			  to skills assessment. I have also been looking at native support for mobile devices,
			  which requires a bit more platform testing than I can execute at this moment.
			  I would like to add some of these features and platform support, if there is sufficient
			  community interest; however, as of this writing, the judging for the competition is taking place,
			  and so I want to leave the current build alone for a few weeks.
			</p>

				This game was created using <a
					href="http://code.google.com/p/playn/">PlayN</a> and <a

				Thanks to the good folks at <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>
				and <a href="http://threerings.com">Three Rings</a> as well as all
				the other contributors.

			<p>Thanks to all my alpha and beta testers!</p>
